# HandOver – React Web (Car Service)

## Overview
**HandOver – React Web (Car Service)** is an earlier responsive web version of the HandOver platform, focused on the **car service module**.  
It enables users to upload a photo of their car, where an **AI engine** detects the vehicle, identifies its **brand logo**, and classifies **damaged parts**.  
Based on the detected brand, the system filters and displays repairers specialized in that manufacturer.
